# Learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

## 1. Get the Basics Right
Before diving into DSA, ensure you understand the following fundamentals:
- **Programming Language**: Master one language like Python, C++, or Java.
- **Mathematical Foundations**: Learn modular arithmetic, permutations, combinations, and logarithms.

## 2. Learn Core Data Structures
Start with understanding and implementing these structures:

| **Data Structure** | **What to Learn**                    | **Example Problems**                     |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Arrays**          | Traversals, Insertions, Deletions, Searching, Sorting | Find the second largest element          |
| **Strings**         | Pattern Matching, Palindrome Check  | Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters |
| **Linked Lists**    | Single/Double/Circular Linked List, Reversals | Detect Loop in Linked List               |
| **Stacks**          | LIFO, Applications (e.g., parentheses matching) | Evaluate Postfix Expression              |
| **Queues**          | FIFO, Priority Queue, Deque         | Implement a Circular Queue               |
| **Hashing**         | Hash Maps, Collision Resolution     | Two Sum Problem                          |
| **Trees**           | Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, Traversals | Lowest Common Ancestor                   |
| **Graphs**          | BFS, DFS, Shortest Path (Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall) | Detect Cycle in a Graph                  |
